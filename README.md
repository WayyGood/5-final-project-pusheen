# Final Project

NutriFit is a handy tool that helps you keep track of what you eat and how much you weigh. It's like a food diary that also keeps an eye on your weight changes. With NutriFit, you can write down every meal and snack, and it'll tell you all about the calories and nutrition in your food. We also incorporated an api, where user can actively check the food's calorie and other information.
